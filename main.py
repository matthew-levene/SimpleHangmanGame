# Hangman Game
#
# Basic hangman game where it takes a single letter as input from the user each round
# Number of rounds is determined by length of word times by 2
# If the letter is not in the list, a piece of the hangman will be drawn
#
# The progress of the hangman will depend on the number of word length
# e.g. the more characters in the word, the longer it takes to draw.
